# Gozio Weather App Coding Challenge

For the Gozio Health iOS coding challenge you have been provided with a starter Weather App project.  The goal of the coding challenge is to connect the Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/current) to the Current Weather Screen displaying the current weather at the Gozio Headquarters.

--------------------------------------------
Current Weather Screen Objectives

Open Weather API endpoint:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=33.78591032377107&lon=-84.40964058633683&appid=3aa158b2f14a9f493a8c725f8133d704&units=imperial

Open Weather API Icons:
https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/10d@2x.png

lat=33.78591032377107 and lon=-84.40964058633683 represent the Gozio Headquarters.

Display the following (the layout doesn’t need to be pixel perfect):
City Name from the Weather API
High/Low Temperatures in Fahrenheit
Current Temperature in Fahrenheit
Weather Description
Sunrise Time
Wind
Humidity
OpenWeather icon on the left side of the screen for the current weather.  Icon is retrieved from Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
Icons for location, sunrise, wind and humidity (included in project assets)

When coding follow the best iOS coding practices.  While the app is simple now, build it with future plans for adding new features and maintainability–so focus on clean code, project structure and architecture.  You may use any non-commercial libraries for api calls or image downloads. The app code should be submitted via a git repository so we can see a few commits showing the progress of your work.

Feel free to reach out with any questions and good luck!
